# CPS630Project
To run the program, first unzip the project files into the htdocs file in XAMPP WITHOUT creating a 
new folder, then start XAMPP and run Apache and MySQL servers, before opening 
localhost/phpMyAdmin/index.php in the browser and creating a new database called SCS in
utf8mb4_general_ci. Then, open the browser to localhost/Team_28_Sec_03/mainpage.php.

In the database will be some initialized values in most tables. There is one admin user,
their credentials are 'kieran pass123' there is no way to create new admin users without
using another admin user.
